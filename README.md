___

To play the game, run the script brickserv.rb to host the game locally, and then navigate with your browser to http://localhost:3000/game/

For testing purposes a test.html page has been created, which loads the game from raw source files.

In order to compile the source into single package, run compile-application.sh shell script. This will generate the level tilemap JSON data and compile the package.js file.
